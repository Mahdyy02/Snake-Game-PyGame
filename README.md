# Snake-Game-PyGame
I worked on the PyGame project quiet a bit and a Youtube Video Clear Code helped a lot make it.
A big thanks to the great work they have done!

It is Object Oriented based and quiet very easy to read and edit if you will.

Don't forget to install PyGame using `pip install pygame` before you run the code and give it a star ⭐ if you like it.
